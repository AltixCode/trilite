# Three failures this exists to prevent, each paid for once across the portfolio:
#   - `expo run:android` can fail in a second and leave the PREVIOUS APK
#     installed, so the app launches, renders, and proves nothing. Each build's
#     own exit code is checked.
#   - A killed emulator leaves AVD lock files and the next start refuses with
#     "Another emulator instance is running", which reads like a stray process.
#   - An emulator and an Xcode build together exhaust this machine, and the
#     symptom shows up on the NEXT app. The emulator is killed before Xcode runs.
#
# iOS ends at "builds, installs, launches, renders": Simulator.app is missing
# from this Xcode install, so there is no window to click and the ATT prompt
# cannot be dismissed. Interaction is driven on Android.
