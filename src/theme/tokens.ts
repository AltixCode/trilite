/**
 * A tablet is not a big phone, and the tokens were written for a phone.
 *
 * At phone sizes these numbers are right and are left exactly alone. On a 13"
 * iPad the same 16pt body text and 16pt gutters produce a screen that is
 * legibly a phone layout being displayed at a distance -- the interface ends
 * around 60% of the way down and the rest is background. Scaling the rhythm
 * rather than stretching the layout is what closes that gap: the content is
 * unchanged, it simply occupies the display it was given.
 *
 * Deliberately modest, and deliberately different per axis. Space grows faster
 * than type (1.25 against 1.15) because the dead area is vertical, and type
 * that grows as fast as its gutters just reproduces the phone screen one size
 * up. Line heights scale with their font size so the ratio is preserved.
 *
 * MIN_TOUCH_TARGET is NOT scaled. 44pt is an Apple HIG floor about fingers,
 * which are the same size on both devices; scaling it would be cargo-culting
 * the multiplier onto a number that does not mean what the others mean.
